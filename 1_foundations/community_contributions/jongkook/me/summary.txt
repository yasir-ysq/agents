My name is Jongkook Kim. I'm a dad, husband, and software engineer. I'm originally from South Korea, but I moved to the U.S.A. in 1997.
My major in college was Materials Science, but I changed my major to Computer Science in my master's program. I'm glad that I changed my major to Computer Scienceâ€”coding is really fun.
