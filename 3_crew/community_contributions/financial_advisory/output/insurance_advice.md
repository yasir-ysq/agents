Based on your financial summary, here is a comprehensive insurance and financial plan tailored to your needs:

### Health Insurance
- **Existing Coverage**: You currently have health insurance, which is essential for protecting against high medical expenses. It's advised to review your current policy to ensure it covers all family members adequately and includes coverage for critical illnesses.
- **Recommended Additions**: Consider adding coverage for day care procedures and alternative treatments which may not be included in basic health policies. Ensure that the coverage limit is at least ₹10 lakhs to cover significant medical expenses that can arise.

### Life Insurance
- **Recommendation**: Acquire a term life insurance policy. Given your financial responsibilities, a coverage amount of at least ₹50 lakhs is recommended. This amount would cover existing debts of ₹1 lakh and provide a safety net for future expenses, especially for your children's education.
- **Premium Estimate**: Depending on your age and health, the annual premium may range around ₹5,000-₹10,000.

### Disability Insurance
- **Recommendation**: Although you do not currently have disability insurance, it is crucial to ensure income protection in case of unforeseen events. Look for a policy that provides a monthly benefit of 60% of your income for a period of at least 3 to 5 years.
- **Estimated Coverage**: If your monthly income is ₹100,000, aim for a benefit of approximately ₹60,000 per month in case of disability. premiums vary but can be expected to be around ₹6,000-₹12,000 annually based on age and health status.

### Property Insurance
- **Recommendation**: As you aim to purchase a house, I strongly recommend taking out a property insurance policy to protect the asset once acquired. Ideally, the coverage should be equivalent to the value of the house, which is ₹1 crore. This insurance will cover damages and liabilities associated with the property.
- **Estimated Premium**: Property insurance costs vary but may be roughly around ₹5,000-₹15,000 annually depending on the location and type of coverage.

### Liability Insurance
- **Recommendation**: To protect against unforeseen legal expenses and claims, consider a personal liability insurance policy with coverage of at least ₹50 lakhs. This safeguards your assets in case of legal issues arising from personal or rented property incidents.
- **Estimated Premium**: This coverage could cost between ₹2,500-₹7,500 per year, depending on the insurer.

### Financial Goals Integration
- **Monthly Savings Strategy**: Based on your goal of buying a house in 5 years, saving ₹16,667 monthly; for children’s education over 14 years, save approximately ₹11,905 monthly; and for retirement, a starting savings of at least ₹10,000 monthly. 
- All the savings should be arranged in a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) tailored towards moderate risk investments to optimize returns.
- Post debt clearance, utilize any remaining surplus to bolster your SIP contributions accordingly.

### Debt Management
- Focus on paying off your current debt of ₹100,000 swiftly to improve cash flow. Allocate a portion of your monthly surplus of ₹50,000 judiciously to chip away at this liability.
