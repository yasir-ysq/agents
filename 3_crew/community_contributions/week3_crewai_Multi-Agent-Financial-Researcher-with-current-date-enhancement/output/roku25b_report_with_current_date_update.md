### Executive Summary

Roku, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROKU) is a preeminent streaming platform company operating primarily in the OTT media segment. As of mid-2025, Roku stands as a dominant player in the streaming device and platform ecosystem with nearly 90 million active streaming households.

In Q2 2025, Roku exhibited strong topline growth and profitability, underscoring improved operational efficiency and robust advertising demand.

Roku’s future growth prospects lie in scaling its advertising platform, broadening subscription content, and carefully expanding its international footprint. Near-term growth remains contingent on macroeconomic factors influencing digital ad spend, device hardware margin pressures, and competitive dynamics in streaming technology.
